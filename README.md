# docker image(s) to build the SCT8-Board

docker image to build the SCT8-Board project

The SCT8-docker image should contain the following items:
  - [petalinux](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/embedded-software/petalinux-sdk.html#tools)
  - [mcuxpresso](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE)
  - brass ... frank what is this one again, and you need it only with petalinux right?

The idea is **not** to host the image(s) on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/), but on [github packages](https://github.com/features/packages), so that the image is faster present when building with [docker actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
