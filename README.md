# docker

A collection of [dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)s used in the [Semi-ATE](https://github.com/Semi-ATE) organization.


Our docker containers will be launched from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and releases go to [github packages](https://github.com/features/packages). Projects that use the docker images then have fast access to them.
