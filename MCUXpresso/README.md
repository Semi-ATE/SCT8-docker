# MCUXpresso

The [MCUXpresso IDE](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE) from [NXP](https://www.nxp.com/) brings developers an easy-to-use Eclipse-based development environment for NXP® MCUs based on Arm® Cortex®-M cores.

We are using the [MK20DN512VMD10](https://www.nxp.com/part/MK20DN512VMD10#/) on the SCT8-Board to control the booting sequence of the different power rails.
