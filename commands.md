## Containers

Use `docker container <command>` where <command> is one of:
  - `create` ➜ Create a container from an image.
  - `start` ➜ Start an existing container.
  - `run` ➜ Create a new container and start it.
    - `docker container run -it -p 1000:8000 --rm <image>`
      - `-i` is short for --interactive. Keep STDIN open even if unattached.
      - `-t` is short for --tty. Allocates a pseudo terminal that connects your terminal with the container’s STDIN and STDOUT.
      - `-p` is short for --port. The port is the interface with the outside world.1000:8000 maps the Docker port 8000 to port 1000 on your machine. If you had an app that output something to the browser you could then navigate your browser to localhost:1000 and see it.
      - `--rm` Automatically delete the container when it stops running.
      - `<image>` 
    - `docker container run -it <image> <command>`
      - `sh` is a command you could specify at run time. `sh` will start a shell session inside your container that you can interact with through your terminal. `sh` is preferable to `bash` __for Alpine images__ because Alpine images don’t come with bash installed. Type `exit` to end the interactive shell session.
    - `docker container run -d <image>`
      - `-d` is short for --detach. Run the container in the background. Allows you to use the terminal for other commands while your container runs.
  - `ls` ➜ List running containers.
    - `docker container ls` ➜ List running containers. Also provides useful information about the containers.
    - `docker container ls -a -s` ➜ List all containers (running or not) with their sizes
      - `-a` is short for -all. List all containers (not just running ones).
      - `-s` is short for --size. List the size for each container.
  - `inspect` ➜ See lots of info about a container.
    - `docker container inspect <container>`
  - `logs` ➜ Print logs.
    - `docker container logs <container>`
  - `stop` ➜ Gracefully stop running container.
    - `docker container stop <container>` ➜ Gives a default of 10 seconds before container shutdown to finish any processes.
    - `docker container stop $(docker ps -q)` ➜ Stop **all running** containers.
  - `kill` ➜ Stop main process in container abruptly.
    - `docker container kill <container>` ➜ It’s like pulling the plug on the TV. Prefer stop in most situations!
    - `docker container kill $(docker ps -q)` ➜ Kill **all running** containers.
  - `rm` ➜ Delete a **stopped** container.
    - `docker container rm <container>` ➜ Delete one or more **stopped** containers.
    - `docker container rm $(docker ps -a -q)` ➜ Delete **all stopped** containers.

## Images

Use `docker image <command>` where <command> is one of:
  - `build` ➜ Build an image.
    - `docker image build -t <repo>/<image>:<tag> .` ➜ Build a Docker image named <image> from the Dockerfile located at the specified path or URL.
      - `-t` is short for tag. Tells docker to tag the image with the provided tag. In this case <tag> .
      - The `.` (period) at the end of the command tells Docker to build the image according to the Dockerfile in the current working directory.
  - `push` ➜ Push an image to a remote registry.
  - `ls` ➜ List images.
    - `docker image ls` ➜ List your images. Shows you the size of each image, too.
  - `history` ➜ See intermediate image info.
  - `inspect` ➜ See lots of info about an image, including the layers.
  - `rm` ➜ Delete an image.

## Misc

  - `docker version` ➜ List info about your Docker Client and Server versions.
  - `docker login` ➜ Log in to a Docker registry.
  - `docker system prune` ➜ Delete all unused containers, unused networks, and dangling images.
